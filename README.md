# CHI-HUI CHOU
I'm a former research assistant at the department of physics at National Taiwan University. I have been a Phd research student in Max-Planck Institute for the physics of the complex systems in Dresden, Germany for 2 years. I'm leaving the academics and looking for works in IT industry.
