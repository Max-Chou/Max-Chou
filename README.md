# CHI-HUI CHOU
I'm a former research assistant at the department of physics at National Taiwan University. I have been a Phd research student in Max-Planck Institute for the physics of the complex systems in Dresden, Germany for 2 years. But I failed to finish my Phd degree and came back to Taiwan in April 2019. I would like to be a software developer because I like to dive deep into software architectures and frameworks. I believe that if you want to build better applications, you have to study hard on good ones and rebuild it from scratch.
